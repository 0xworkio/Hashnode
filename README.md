# Hashnode Clone

This is a **full-stack application** that serves as a clone of the popular blogging website, _Hashnode_. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in web development and serve as a learning experience. I have utilized Next.js, Nextjs, Tailwind CSS, and the T3 stack with PostgreSQL as the technology stack for this project. With a plethora of exciting features, this intermediate-level project replicates approximately 80% of the functionalities found on the original Hashnode website. Furthermore, I have designed the user interface entirely from scratch. This project is _still under development_, and I will continue to add more eciting features to it. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I enjoyed building it. Cheers üçª. Contributions are welcome!
